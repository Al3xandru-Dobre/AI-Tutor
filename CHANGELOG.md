## Development Notes

### Version 1.0.0 Highlights
This initial release establishes the Japanese AI Tutor as a comprehensive language learning platform with advanced AI capabilities. The system combines local knowledge bases with real-time internet search to provide accurate, contextual responses for Japanese language learners at all levels.

### Architecture Decisions
- **Microservices approach**: Separate services for RAG, internet search, and orchestration
- **Docker-first deployment**: Ensures consistent environments across development and production
- **Multi-source RAG**: Combines local and internet sources for comprehensive responses
- **Fallback mechanisms**: Graceful degradation when services are unavailable

### Future Development
The project is structured to support future enhancements including voice integration, mobile applications, advanced analytics, and personalized learning paths.
