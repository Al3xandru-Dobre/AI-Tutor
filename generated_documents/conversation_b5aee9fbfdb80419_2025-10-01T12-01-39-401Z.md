Congratulations on starting your Japanese learning journey! Let's create a study guide for particles.

**Particles Study Guide**

In Japanese, particles (, jirushi) are essential grammatical elements that indicate relationships between words in a sentence. We'll focus on two fundamental particles: は (wa) and が (ga).

**1. は (wa) - Topic Marker**

は (wa) is used to indicate what the sentence is about or to introduce a topic.

* Example: 私は学生です (Watashi wa gakusei desu)
	+ Pronunciation: Wa-ta-shi wa ga-kue-i des-u
	+ Translation: "As for me, I am a student"
* Use は (wa) when:
	+ Introducing a topic: What are you doing? 私は勉強しています (Watashi wa benkyou shite imasu)
	+ Contrasting ideas: A vs. B: AppleとBanana (, Appuru to Bananā)

**2. が (ga) - Subject Marker**

が (ga) marks the grammatical subject and emphasizes who or what is performing an action.

* Example: 私が勉強しています (Watashi ga benkyou shite imasu)
	+ Pronunciation: Wa-ta-shi ga be-nyo-u shi-te i-mas-u
	+ Translation: "I am studying"
* Use が (ga) when:
	+ Emphasizing the subject: 私が彼を好きです (Watashi ga kare o suki desu)
	+ Indicating the subject of a sentence: Who is eating? 彼が食べます (Kare ga tabemasu)

**Practice Time!**

Try these exercises to practice using は (wa) and が (ga):

1. Complete the sentences with the correct particle:
	* 私は (_____)勉強しています。 (Watashi wa / ga benkyou shite imasu)
2. Use は (wa) to introduce a new topic: What do you like doing in your free time? 私は（_____）好きです。

**Additional Tips**

* Remember, は (wa) is often used to indicate the topic of a sentence.
* が (ga) emphasizes the subject and is commonly used with verbs that require it.

This study guide should give you a solid foundation for understanding particles in Japanese. Practice regularly, and you'll become more comfortable using them in your own sentences!

Next lesson, we can explore other essential particles or move on to verb conjugation. Let me know what you'd like to focus on next!
