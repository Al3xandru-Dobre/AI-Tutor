## 📖 Reading Order

For understanding this release:

1. **Start**: `CHANGELOG_V3.2.0.md` - What changed
2. **Architecture**: `REFACTORING_COMPLETE.md` - How it's organized

## 🎓 For Developers

### Understanding the New Architecture

```
Request Flow:
1. Client sends request to endpoint
2. Route receives request
3. ensureServicesInitialized middleware checks if services ready
4. Controller gets services via getServices()
5. Controller executes business logic
6. Controller sends response
```

### Adding New Features

```javascript
// 1. Create controller
const { getServices } = require('../middlewear/initialise');

async function myFeature(req, res) {
    const { myService } = getServices();
    // Logic here
}

// 2. Create route
router.post('/endpoint', ensureServicesInitialized, myFeature);

// 3. Mount in server.js
app.use('/api/my', myRoute);
```
