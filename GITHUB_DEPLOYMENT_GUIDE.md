## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by X commits"

This means you have local commits not pushed yet. Just push:
```bash
git push origin main
```

### Issue: "Updates were rejected because the remote contains work"

Someone else pushed changes. Pull first:
```bash
git pull origin main --rebase
git push origin main
```

### Issue: "Large files detected"

If you accidentally added large files:
```bash
# Remove from staging
git reset HEAD large_file.pdf

# Add to .gitignore
echo "generated_documents/*.pdf" >> .gitignore
```

### Issue: "Permission denied (publickey)"

Set up SSH key or use HTTPS:
```bash
# Use HTTPS instead
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/Al3xandru-Dobre/AI-Tutor.git
```
