# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

So far, I manage to develop two versions. Yet none of them has a database yet, in the future updates I will add suport for further user pricvacy and integration.
I want the app to be free, user friendly and most important secure. Thus, I would be greatfull for you to report any issues or reports on regarding security and privacy.
You can either do that by opening a discussion on GitHUb, contacting me directly or using the dedicated FeedBack button in the app.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.0   | :white_check_mark: |
| 1.5.0   | :x:                |

Note: Only version 1.5.0 is actively supported. Future updates will focus on user privacy and security improvements.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Reported vulnerabilities shall be most importantly reproduceable. Give clear steps of how you encounter the issue, how does it effects the user or user privacy or security. Provide any
kind of insight of how you stumble across that. It would be also advised to give information in regarding to deployment, os and variables.

Any report will be taken sriously as long as it has clear evidence and it will be solved. Thank you again, for co operation and willing to report and spend time adressing the issues.
Bu this, we make the community a better place and internet safer !
